# 2048

This repository contains all the code for my ICS3U (Introduction to Computer Science) Summative Project, completed in January 2023.

It is a clone of the game 2048 using the Java Swing library with features such as choosing the colour palette, changing the size of the board, and keeping track of high scores.
