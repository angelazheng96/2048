# 2048

This repository contains all the code for my ICS3U (Introduction to Computer Science) Summative Project, completed in January 2023.

It is a clone of the game 2048 using the Java Swing library with features such as:
• choosing colour palette
• changing size of board
• keeping track of high scores
